# NightsTale

NightsTale is a mobile web application designed to help you find the best night out with your friends. Instead of searching through lists of events and crossrefrencing their location you can see all the events around you and filter by type of event. You can also search events by what your friends have reviewed and favourited for later as well as seeing what the most popular events for all users are.
